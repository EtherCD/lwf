# Todo

1. Write documentation
2. Add more errors excepts, and more protection for not parsable segments files
3. Add comments, idk
4. Add more tests
5. Change format of saving booleans, to some more compact
6. Fix artefact with array of objects, when array of objects is added, stringify adds empty block data.

# In future

2. May make this format more than just data saving in text format
